1. Its good to have a flexible routine,  having things to do when you feel stuck 

2. Its tedious to read all the books, look at all the codes, read all the recent research papers. Its better to have a system to store the meat of them, knowing that you will use them later on.
3.  When you will use it? Where will you use it? Why will you use it? #keyquestions
4.  For project like tasks like research, planning might do the opposite work when you get stuck on #GTD #nextactions
5. For the task of research, reading and note taking a lot of paper at first is wrong since it will limit your posibilities of new research
6. Dont use tools for the sake of them. If a tool is not being used on a daily, weekly basis, maybe its time to drop it and replace it by reinforcing the concrete ones.

## Notes:
- This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way
- Good, productive writing is based on good note-taking
- Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests.
-  If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.
