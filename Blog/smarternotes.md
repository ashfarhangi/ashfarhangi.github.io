- Notes should live in the most important context #secondbrain #natelasion
	- Copy taken notes and put them in your output folder (paper, presentation, ...)

1. Its good to have a flexible routine,  having things to do when you feel stuck 

2. Its tedious to read all the books, look at all the codes, read all the recent research papers. Its better to have a system to store the meat of them, knowing that you will use them later on.
3.  When you will use it? Where will you use it? Why will you use it? #keyquestions
4.  For project like tasks like research, planning might do the opposite work when you get stuck on #GTD #nextactions
5. For the task of research, reading and note taking a lot of paper at first is wrong since it will limit your posibilities of new research
6. Dont use tools for the sake of them. If a tool is not being used on a daily, weekly basis, maybe its time to drop it and replace it by reinforcing the concrete ones.
